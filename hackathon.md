Learn a New Technology Hackathon is a series of hackathons in which a
group of data scientists and engineers learn to build something use a new technology.
Once a month, we spend one day building something cool and then
vote amongst ourselves to determine a winner.
See the [Showcase](/index.html#portfolio) for winning entries.
Also checkout our [GitHub organization page](http://github.com/lanthack) for all the entries.
